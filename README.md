# VTuber Style Logo Collection

This project is a collection of cute VTuber style logos. The credits can be founded in `src/data/credits.ts`. Thanks to their great works!

Currently, all logos are shown on [https://vtuber-style-logos.vercel.app/](https://vtuber-style-logos.vercel.app/).

## How to Add Logos?

Currently I create 2 scripts for generating sources from [Aikoyori](https://github.com/Aikoyori) and [Sawaratsuki](https://twitter.com/sawaratsuki1004). When the storage structure becoming stable, I will use GitHub Action for automation.

If there're more logos on Internet that this project haven't collected yet, you can make a pull request to add them manually.

## Development

```bash
pnpm i
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
